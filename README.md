# geometry-tns

A small file with common geometry functions. The file is in German and I consider this project final, but I'm open to pull requests, for example for internationalization.

This can only be used with TI-Nspire calculators or [an emulator](https://github.com/nspire-emus/firebird).

I cannot provide the system dumps of my calculator so you'll have to extract them from your own calculator or get your hands on them in other ways. I obviously won't recommend anything here.
